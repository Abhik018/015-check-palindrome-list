# Find out whether a list is a palindrome

**Notes:**
* Define a function which will accept list as parameter.
* Reverse the list and verify if reverse and actual list are matching.
* If yes then list is palindrome and return true, else false.

**Instructions:**
* We have created a file for you named build.py.
* Inside this file we have created a function for you named solution.
* You have to code inside this function only.
* In advance python we will cover you how to create functions and classes.
* Function always should return something. In our case it should return expected output from program.
* If you do not follow these steps test cases will not execute and you can not submit the code.
